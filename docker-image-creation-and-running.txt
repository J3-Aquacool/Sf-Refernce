// Creating Our First docker Image and containerize and running


Step 1: create a directory in your local machine

ex: MyApp


Step 2: change to your directory 

cd MyApp

Step 3: Lets create  a sample index.html and host it on nginx server


step 4: create a docker file as shown below
FROM nginx   // we are asking docker to get nginx image available over docker hub
RUN rm /usr/share/nginx/html/*    // this will remove default files in nginx server
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/ // here the local html file will be copied to 
the directory of nginx server


step 5: lets build a image using docker commands and docker file

docker build -t myngapp .
next use the command to verify docker images are create ?:docker images

step 6: After successfuly creating lets bind this image to container and run it

docker run -p 9494:80 myngapp 

9494: is the port number which will be used to acces the application from local machine

80 is the port redirected to run this on docker

step 7: open the browser and type
http://localhost:9494/
http://localhost:9494/index.html
